The old system was aging, not ergonomic, and couldn't keep up with increasing production rates. Production teams faced risks of MSDs (Musculoskeletal Disorders) during repeated handling.",
      "solution": "LLEDO AEROTOOLS developed a custom solution with specific adaptations: ergonomic hydraulic control system, reinforced skids for intensive use (3 cycles/day), quick-lock system to reduce preparation time, and anti-scratch coating to preserve helicopter skid conditions.",
